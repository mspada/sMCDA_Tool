# sMCDA Tool
sMCDA Tool is a Shiny tool for spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis problems. The tool considers definite or uncertain inputs and can run two different types of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis methods: i) weighted sum; ii) ELECTRE-TRI. In both cases, the tool can run a SMAA approach for uncertainty quantification. Results can be saved as images, csv, xlsx and ESRI shape files.
